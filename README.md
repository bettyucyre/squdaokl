# How to Get Unbanned on SQUAD (2025 Guide) 🎯

Getting banned from SQUAD can feel like a punch to the gut—especially if you’re convinced it was a total mix-up. No worries! This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal like a pro to get your account back in action.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit immediately after making a shiny new account, or does the ban follow you no matter what account you use? You could be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means SQUAD has blacklisted your PC hardware, making it tough to join the fight even with fresh accounts.
