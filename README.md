<p>Getting banned from SQUAD can feel like a punch to the gut—especially if you’re convinced it was a total mix-up. No worries! This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal like a pro to get your account back in action.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit immediately after making a shiny new account, or does the ban follow you no matter what account you use? You could be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means SQUAD has blacklisted your PC hardware, making it tough to join the fight even with fresh accounts.</p>
